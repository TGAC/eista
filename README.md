## Introduction

**nf-core/eista** is a bioinformatics pipeline that perform analysis for single-cell spatial transcriptomics data (Vizgen data). The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes (implemented and to be implemented) are as follows:

- **Primary analysis**
  - Cell segmentation - defines cell boundaries from images 
  - Partition transcripts - determine which cell contains each detected transcript
  - Calculate cell metadata - calculate the geometric attributes of each cell
  - Sum signals - find the intensity of each mosaic image in each cell
  - Update vzg - Updates an existing .vzg file with new segmentation boundaries and expression matrix
- **Secondary analysis**
  - QC & cell filtering - cell filtering and QC on raw data and filtered data
  - Clustering analysis - single-cell clustering analysis
  - Merging/integration of samples 
  - Spatial statistics analysis - Neighbor enrichment analysis, calculating centrality scores and Moran's I score
- **Tertiary analysis**
  - Cell type annotation
  - Differential expression analysis
  - Cell-cell communication analysis
  - Other downstream analyses (to be implemented)
- **Pipeline reporting**
  - Analysis report - Single-ell Analysis Report.
  - MultiQC - Aggregate report describing results and QC for tools registered in nf-core
  - Pipeline information - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution


<!-- TODO nf-core:
   Complete this sentence with a 2-3 sentence summary of what types of data the pipeline ingests, a brief overview of the
   major pipeline sections and the types of output it produces. You're giving an overview to someone new
   to nf-core here, in 15-20 seconds. For an example, see https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/README.md#introduction
-->

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/eista \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://github.com/TGAC/eista/blob/master/docs/usage.md).
